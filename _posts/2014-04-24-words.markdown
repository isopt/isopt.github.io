This posting was made by Taeyoon Choi on April 24th in Brooklyn. 

We ordered some books that are related to the project. We plan to take notes and share thoughts on time and technology over the next few months. We are especially interested in French philosophers such as Bernard Stiegler and Gilbert Simondon as well as non-academic thinkers.

As we read, we are trying to keep notes of our thoughts and conversations. We will be sharing these as we go on and we hope to aggregate in some kind of publication later on. Nick and I are reading Stiegler's _Technics and Time 1_. 

Stay tuned for the updates and feel free to contact us if you'd like to share thoughts on the readings.
