Timekeeper Invention Club explores the meaning of 'personalized time' as part of the research and public engagement for In Search of Personalized Time (I—S—O—P—T).  

Taeyoon Choi and E Roon Kang presented Timekeeper Invention Club Workshop in Art + Technology Lab at Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) on August 30th, 2014. The workshop started with presentation by the artists about their previous projects as well as the impetus behind collaborating on I—S—O—P—T.

E Roon talked about some of his personal works, including [Manual:The Manual](http://eroonkang.com/projects/manual-the-manual/), [Additive White](http://eroonkang.com/projects/study-additive-white/), sharing his pessimistic yet humorous view to the overly calculated, complicated society. With the projects such as [Trash Track](http://eroonkang.com/projects/trash-track/), a project with SENSEable City Lab supporting the argument, he pointed out that the socially shared expectation of efficiency often leads to the abject pointlessness.

Taeyoon talked about sense of displacement and communion in the time of jet lag. “Jet lag describes the site of love as time in which one is alone, e.g. awake alone in the night, socially less compatible and in this time-space of aloneness one can love and be loved without a division of self and the other.” (Max Andrews, <a href="http://www.lttds.org/assets/Andrews-HaegueYang-ENGL.pdf"> Towards Hague Yang's Blind Rooms</a>) He also showed drawings inspired by being on and out of time, and talked about how he's considering time as a malleable material while making hardware for digital and analog timekeeping and memory.

They also talked about the current state of the project, their unique research method through experimental events such as Real-Time Film Club and plans for making series of prototypes inspired by critical theory, design and technology. They also introduced keywords for the project: Simultaneity, Synchronization, Standardization and subsequently related themes: sense of place, memory and action, as well as the methods of investigation: to give form and to negotiate.

After a brief break, the artists introduced Timekeeper Invention Kit: a complete package of tools and material for the participants to make their own timekeeper, or 'personal time machine'. In the Kit, there were handmade objects: such as smart phone crafted out of balsa, electronics: such as LED, motor, paper circuit, as well as variety of construction and drawing material. Everyone got a paper box, vaguely resembling a box for smart phones or jewelry, and they were asked to create a timekeeper to give form to their personal sense of time.

Next step was a collective brainstorming with the participant. Using the keywords and themes that were introduced earlier as anchors, the participants' thoughts and anecdotes were mapped out on the wall of the Lab. After group discussion about various keywords and stories, the participants focused on making their own timekeeper. The artists assisted with the conceptualizing and constructing the timekeepers. A few participants collaborated on their timekeeper.

The final step was for the participants to demonstrate their timekeeper's functionality and story in front of camera for 1 minute. There were wide range of outcome. Jake, a young boy, in collaboration with his father, [made a watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwSVnsNdwWw) that the speed of time passing can be controlled by a knob. The dial reads from 1 to 14th hour and it's minute hand and hour hand are glued together, thus the hands are always 90 degrees apart. In the video, he demonstrates rolling of the clock hands and guessing where it has landed, simialr to the wheel of fortune.

Another participant made [a box to count her age](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWhb1elqhFA), with long sticks of wood as a sign of decade and short stick as a sign of year. On her 60th birthday, she will take out 9 short sticks from the box and keep it in a pocket attached to the box and put in a long stick.

Julianne and Maxwell collaborated on a [Limited Edition Infinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUag8vrAjvM), an electronic circuit with a dozen of LEDs arranged in shape of infinity sign, connected parallel to a 3 Volt battery. The catch is the battery has been soldered to the circuit, and the infinity will last only as long as the energy remains in the battery.

In previous weekend, the artists hosted the same workshop at [Orbital](http://orbitalnyc.com/) in New York City. Friends and members of the community participated to make their own timekeepers. [Ishac Bertran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJ-zU7EPMM&list=PLXfQk5ShZ9LZzlrO3N35vJfepFlyB52Pp&index=14) created a binary clock based on the concept of flip flop and [Ellie Irons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN5kxRrqOiU&index=16&list=PLXfQk5ShZ9LZzlrO3N35vJfepFlyB52Pp) created multidimensional timekeeper based on phenology and academic calendar year. [Lauren McCarthy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ln4e6Fe9oQE&list=PLXfQk5ShZ9LZzlrO3N35vJfepFlyB52Pp&index=12) animated a story about lovers frustration with different sense of time, and [Dan Phiffer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPlDSJ-7gLA&list=PLXfQk5ShZ9LZzlrO3N35vJfepFlyB52Pp&index=10) talked about different ways to avoid indication of time on a smart phone.

Through this collaborative thought exercise, Taeyoon and E Roon are trying to provide an opportunity to rethink about time and to give form to our perception of time. Some aspects of the kits and workshop are based on commentary of our obsession of 'personalization' in ownership and customization of digital device as well as in its mediation of communication and our sense of presence. By making conceptual timekeepers with common materials, the workshop is an encouragement to craft everyone's sense of time.

The artists are planning to do third incarnation of Timekeeper Invention Club at [Design Exchange Boston](http://www.dxboston.com/session/timekeeper-invention-club/) on 9.28.2014 and continue to explore personal sense of time and archive short videos of other people's inventions on the [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXfQk5ShZ9LZzlrO3N35vJfepFlyB52Pp) channel.
