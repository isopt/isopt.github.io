In Timekeeper Invention Club, Taeyoon Choi and E Roon Kang shared their research process behind In Search of Personalized Time (I-S-O-P-T) by exploring the meaning of 'personalized time' with the workshop participants. 

Timekeeper Invention Club was presented in Art + Technology Lab at Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) on August 30th, 2014. The workshop started with presentation by the artists about their previous projects as well as the impetus behind collaborating on I-S-O-P-T.

E Roon talked about his projects such as Manual: The Manual: Rethinking Inefficient Disciplines of Efficiency and Trash Track, made in collaboration at MIT SENSEable City Lab. The core argument of his talk was pessimistic and yet humorous investigation about the society's expectation for him to become more efficient. 

Taeyoon talked about sense of displacement at the moments of jet lag. Quoting Haegue Yang “Jet lag describes the site of love as time in which one is alone, e.g. awake alone in the night, socially less compatible and in this time-space of aloneness one can love and be loved without a division of self and the other.” He showed some drawings inspired by being on and out of time. Considering time as a malleable object, he's making hardware for timekeeping and digital and analog memory.

They talked about the current state of the project, their unique research method through experimental events such as Real-time Film Club and plans for making series of prototypes inspired by critical theory, design and technology. They also introduced keywords for the project: Simultaneity, Synchronization, Standardization and subsequently related themes: sense of place, memory and action, as well as the methods of investigation: to give form and to negotiate.

After a brief break, the artists introduced Timekeeper Invention Kit: a complete package of tools and material for the participants to make their own timekeeper, or 'personal time machine'. In the Kit, there were handmade objects: such as smart phone crafted out of balsa, electronics: such as LED, motor, paper circuit, as well as variety of construction and drawing material. Everyone got a paper box, vaguely resembling a box for smart phones or jewelry, and they were asked to create a timekeeper to give form to their personal sense of time.

Next step was a collective brainstorming with the participant. Using the keywords and themes that were introduced earlier as anchors, the participants' thoughts and anecdotes were mapped out on the wall of the Lab. After group discussion about various keywords and stories, the participants focused on making their own timekeeper. The artists assisted with the conceptualizing and constructing the timekeepers. Few participants collaborated on the timekeeper.

Final step was for the participants to demonstrate their timekeeper's functionality and story in front of camera for 1 minute. There were wide range of outcome. Jake, a young boy, in collaboration with his father, made a watch that the speed of time passing can be controlled by a knob. The dial reads from 1 to 14th hour and it's minute hand and hour hand are glued together, thus the hands are always 90 degrees apart.  Another participant made a box to count her age, with long sticks of wood as a sign of decade and short stick as a sign of year. In every birthday, she will put in new stick into the box, and keep the remaining sticks in a pocket outside of the box. On her 60th birthday, she will take out 9 short sticks from the box and put in a long stick. Julianne and Maxwell collaborated on a Limited Edition Infinity, an electronic circuit with a dozen of LEDs arranged in shape of infinity sign, connected parallel to a 3 Volt battery. The catch is the battery has been soldered to the circuit, and the infinity will last only as long as the energy remains in the battery.

In previous weekend, the artists hosted same workshop in New York City. Friends and members of the community participated to make their own timekeepers. For example Ishac Bertran's binary clock based on the concept of flip flop, Ellie Irons' multidimensional timekeeper based on phenology and academic calendar year and Lauren McCarthy's animated a story about lovers frustration with different sense of time. Dan Phiffer told about different ways to avoid indication of time on a smart phone.

Through this collaborative thought exercise, the artists are trying to provide an opportunity to rethink about time and to give form to our perception of time. Some aspects of the kits and workshop are based on commentary of our obsession of 'personalization' in ownership and customization of digital device as well as in its mediation of communication and our sense of presence. By making conceptual timekeepers with common materials, the workshop is an encouragement to craft everyone's sense of time.  

The artists are planning to do third incarnation of Timekeeper Invention Club at Design Exchange Boston on 9.28.2014 and continue to explore personal sense of time and archive short videos of other people's inventions on the youtube channel.
