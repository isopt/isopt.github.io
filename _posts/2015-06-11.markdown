Today at LMCC Workspace in 315 Hudson, E Roon, Charlotte and I worked on following things. 

We brainstormed about the name for the event. 

##The adjective of the gathering. 
![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/346/18562330179_ab847ace8f_z.jpg=400x)

- Forum
- Group
- ~~Department~~
- ~~Institution~~
- ~~Agency~~
- Society 
- ~~Union~~
- Association
- Alliance
- Circle
- ~~Bureau~~
- Order 

And we crossed out the ones which felt a bit too institutional and rigid. What we want is a sense of open ended event where the participants will explore these concepts with us. 

The secret society feels like Bataille's Acephale.

##The objective of the gathering.

- Consensus ~~Time~~
- Personalized ~~Time~~
- Consensus and Personalized ~~Time~~
- ~~Time~~ Alternatives 
- Measurement of ~space 
- Measurement of moments
- Measurement of instances
- Happenings
- Passing 
- Being
- Temporal

And we crossed out everything that had Time in the name, because it felt redundant to have time in the title of the event, as the project in general is called "In Search of Personalized Time"


##What are we really trying to do here
- Measure (give form, quantify) the passing of moments
- Congregation of order of happenings
- Redesign of time
- Union for the measurement of Past - Present - Future
- Estimation of Past - Present - Future
- Past - Present - Future Invention Circle 
- Circle of appreciation of individualized time 
- Society of moments and play of time

And we paused to think about what would be the exeperience we are trying to deliver to the museum visitors and the workshop participants.

- It's to live in an alternative time.
- Introduce to new ways of looking and events nad memories.
- It's a make-believe and simulation of time.

In the end we have

- Past - Present - Future Invention Circle 
- The society of Past - Present - Future 
- **The Circle of Past - Present - Future  Invention**
- **Circle of Moment Measurement** 
- Committee of personalization and measurement of moment 
- New Moment Measurement Circle

We decided to give prompts for the participants when they went out with the personal timekeepers. It will be paired up with cold water and cookie, and maybe Gimbab. 

##The prompts for the personalized time

##Schedule 
In the response to our previous email, Joel asked if we can host the Saturday event as private and Sunday as open to the public. We also think that's a good idea. 

*"We talked about your news suggestion and we think it's a good idea. Let's keep the Saturday event private as a 'Beta test' with invited friends, artists and LACMA Art + Tech Lab community. Sunday event will be as open as possible for LACMA audience to experience the piece. We think we can create an engaging experience between 12~4pm on Sunday."* - from my email.

- GSM 2G SIM Card from Ting & Adafruit - Data/Voice/Text USA Only
- Right-angle Mini GSM/Cellular Quad-Band Antenna - 2dBi SMA Plug
- Adafruit 1.2" 4-Digit 7-Segment Display w/I2C Backpack

##Exterior design
Now that all the electronic parts for the hardware is ordered and on it's way, we began to sketch out. E Roon made a quick prototype with Tuna Can and masking tapes.

The Tuna is actually a gift from David Horvitz, whose work I mentioned during the meeting today.

 This project of making small bells out of giant bells, making personal clocks is definitley one of the inspiration for ISOPT project

*Mr. Horvitz greeted his volunteers by the staircase, a sunflower in one hand and a bike helmet in the other. “Hey, did you guys know that today is the solstice?” he asked. His eyes darted around, searching for enthusiasm. There were quite a few smiles. He gave his instructions: we would begin by ringing the bells 12 times as a group at 12:57 p.m.. It was the local noon of that day, he explained, the time when the sun is actually highest in the sky. Local noon, the midpoint between sunrise and sunset, changes based on the day’s length, so the solstice made noon late that day. After a dozen rings, we would disperse, still waving our bells, walking until we could no longer hear any of the sister bells.* from [New York Observer](http://observer.com/2014/06/in-search-of-new-time-david-horvitz-at-the-new-museum/#ixzz3csfvGC1m)

Charlotte made some sketch ups.

This is the image of electronic hardware. The further out is the Seven segment number display, middle one is the Raspberry Pi computer and the last one is the battery.

Here's Charlotte. 

 

##Pamphlets

- Printed object
- Something that’s personalized for them.
- The prompts are noted in the pamphlets. It’s like a check list of things to do
